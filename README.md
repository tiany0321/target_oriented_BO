# Target-oriented Bayesian optimization strategy 
A target-oriented Bayesian optimization strategy, t-EGO, is demonstrated for designing materials with target-specific properties.

The accompanying documentation includes codes for implementing t-EGO, along with two other Bayesian optimization strategies.
